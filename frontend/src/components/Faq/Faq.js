const faqs = [ { question: "What is a Rooftop Solar Project?", answer: "A rooftop solar project involves installing solar panels on the roof of your home to generate electricity using sunlight. The power generated can be used for household consumption, and any surplus can be fed back to the grid through net metering.", }, { question: "What is the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana?", answer: "The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched by the Government of India, aims to provide free electricity up to 300 units per month for households that adopt rooftop solar. The scheme includes subsidies, financial support, and easy loan facilities to make solar energy affordable for domestic consumers.", }, { question: "Who can apply for the PM Surya Ghar scheme?", answer: "Any residential household with a suitable rooftop can apply. The house must have a valid electricity connection in the name of the applicant. The rooftop must be technically feasible for installing solar panels (sufficient space, sunlight availability, and structural strength).", }, { question: "What financial benefits are available under the PM Surya Ghar scheme?", answer: "Central Government Subsidy: Up to ₹78,000 subsidy (depending on the system capacity). Zero upfront cost option: Consumers can apply for loans from banks/NBFCs where subsidies directly reduce the loan burden. Savings on electricity bills: Reduced or zero monthly power bills, plus income from selling excess power to the grid.", }, { question: "How much subsidy will I get for my rooftop solar system?", answer: "The subsidy is linked to the capacity of the system:\n1 kW – Rs. 30,000/-\n2 kW - Rs. 60,000/-\n3 kW or above - Rs. 78,000/-\n(Subsidy amounts may vary between States depending on additional incentives provided by State Governments, and are also subject to change in accordance with future directives from the Government of India.)", }, { question: "How do I apply for rooftop solar under this scheme?", answer: "Visit the National Portal for Rooftop Solar (www.pmsuryaghar.gov.in). Register with your electricity consumer number. Submit your application and choose a vendor registered with your state DISCOM. Install the system through the approved vendor. Claim your subsidy after installation and verification. Or just CALL WISDA Team for handling the work from survey to subsidy.", }, { question: "Are loans available for rooftop solar installations?", answer: "Yes. Multiple financing options are available: Public Sector Banks (SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, etc.) offer priority sector loans at lower interest rates.

Repayment periods generally range from 5–10 years.", }, { question: "What are the technical requirements for rooftop solar?", answer: "Available roof space (approx. 100 sq. ft. per kW). Unshaded exposure to sunlight for most of the day. Net Metering facility approved by your DISCOM. Use of MNRE-approved panels and inverters. WE (WISDA Energy) ensures all installations meet statutory, technical, and safety guidelines.", }, { question: "What approvals are required?", answer: "DISCOM approval for net metering. Compliance with MNRE standards. Registration on the National Rooftop Solar Portal. WE (WISDA Energy) assists customers at every step to simplify the documentation and approval process.", }, { question: "How will rooftop solar reduce my electricity bill?", answer: "The system generates free power from sunlight. You use the solar energy first, reducing dependence on the grid. Surplus power is exported to the grid, and you receive credit via net metering. In many cases, bills drop to zero or stay at minimum fixed charges.", }, { question: "Why should I choose WISDA Energy for my rooftop solar system?", answer: "WISDA Energy goes beyond standard installations by offering: 5-Year Comprehensive Warranty on every system.
